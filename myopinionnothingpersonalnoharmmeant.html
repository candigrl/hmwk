    <h1>This is my opinion of the program</h1>
    <p>I am trying to learn this program that the Department of Labor has afforded me. 
           However, It may be just me but i am finding it far simpler to learn on the 
           internet then in this classroom.
           I am wondering if it wouldnt be more cost effective to allow students to do 
           an online enrollment.
        <p>I have ask repeatedly for a tutor but my need has fallen on deaf ears. 
           I don't think its personal, it just feels like it's thought if a person comes through the WIOA program 
           that they aren't worthy of the time investment. It's as if, if we don't keep up with everything at the same 
           pace that perhaps a very select few of the students that have been working or learning in the field are keeping
           up, then we're thought of as stupid and that we're just not worth the extra time and are only a waste of space and time
           for wanting to learn this program.
        <p>Well, contrary to the teaching methods used, or my personal opinion, i will with
           the grace of the most high God pass this class. And, i will have learned, even if just at a good starting point, what i need to
           know to pass this program with the ability to code and build websites at a scale that 
           will produce a livable income for me.</p>
    
         <ul>
            <li>I will use the internet as my friend,
               I will continue reading all notes and
               the syllabus,</li>

            <li id="example">I will research and apply what i am able to learn from both the class as best i can and
               from the internet with the hope that if i put everything together in a cohesive manner
               it will result that i have learned many viabable and financially beneficial skill from this program.
